      <h1>Advise Service</h1>
      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>
        Our advisory service caters to a limited number of teams and partner businesses, offering
        on-demand support and guidance. We specialize in providing comprehensive advice and
        recommendations on TypeScript best practices tailored to meet the unique needs of each
        client.
      </p>

      <h2>Expert Guidance</h2>
      <p>
        Our team of experts provides valuable insights and recommendations based on industry best
        practices and extensive experience. This guidance helps teams make informed decisions, avoid
        common pitfalls in TypeScript development and receive advice on particular problems they
        face.
      </p>

      <h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
      <p>
        Our advisory service fosters a culture of continuous improvement within teams by providing
        ongoing support and updates on the latest developments in TypeScript. This enables teams to
        adopt many of the best-practices that are not always easy to adopt in one sweeping change
        but instead can be added to a project incrementally with the help of our advisory service.
      </p>

      <h2>Regular advice</h2>
      <p>
        Upon request, we offer regularly scheduled one-on-one or group consultations aimed at
        enhancing developers' understanding of TypeScript and their ability to write high-quality
        code. Additionally, we can participate in code reviews and other feedback processes to
        further support development teams.
