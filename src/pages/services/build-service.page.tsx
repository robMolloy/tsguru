      <h2>What we do</h2>
      <p>
        We offer a comprehensive design and build approach for developing front-end or back-end
        TypeScript applications. This takes into account all parts of the project management
        lifecycle from working with stakeholders in order to to understand the requirements, to
        designing the architecture, creating the product and ensuring a successful handover back to
        the client.
      </p>

      <h2>High-quality solutions</h2>
      <p>
        Our team designs and constructs robust, scalable architectures tailored to deliver efficient
        and future-proof solutions. By leveraging best practices in TypeScript and software
        engineering, we ensure that our solutions can adapt and grow with your business needs.
      </p>

      <h2>From build to maintenance phase</h2>
      <p>
        We work collaboratively with existing development teams, to ensure knowledge transfer and
        alignment with project goals. This collaboration extends to preparing teams for a smooth
        transition from the build phase to the maintenance phase, ensuring sustainability, log-term
        success for the project, with a smooth hassle-free handover phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        To facilitate the transition from build-phase to maintenance-phase, we are able to provide
        comprehensive training sessions aimed at increasing developers' skills and understanding of
        TypeScript and the intricacies of the project. This ensures that your team is not only ready
        to take over the project but also capable of maintaining and evolving it effectively.
      </p>

      <h2>Communication</h2>
      <p>
        As with any good product delivery, we provide detailed estimates and timelines to ensure
        stakeholders have a clear understanding of the project's scope and schedule. Through good
        communication lines, demos and other methods of communicating the project's progress we keep
        stakeholders up-to-date and provide the appropriate level of certainty throughout the
        process.
      </p>

      <h2>Tooling</h2>
      <p>
        We provide expertise in many of the state-of-the-art tooling that should be expected on any
        high-quality modern project to ensure a successful development process. This includes;
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Automated deployments for fast iterative development</li>
        <li>Unit tests and scenario-driven integration tests to ensure quality</li>
        <li>Documentation such as swagger and storybook</li>
      </ul>
